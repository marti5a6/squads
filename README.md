### Introduction

Squads is a Maven-based web-app that allows for individuals to create groups (or “squads”) and communicate ideas together in one fluid chat. 

Users will have unique logins and be able to add users to their squad by username. 

Direct messaging will also be possible, as well as potentially profile customization. 

Support for image/file-sharing is also a planned endeavor.
